        <h3>Harvey Dale</h3>
        <p class="dale">Lead Vocals and Guitar. A determined and passionate singer since the age of five, Dale blends his poetic, lyrical riffs with music chords.</p>
        <h3>Rosie Martin</h3>
        <p class="martin">Supporting Vocals and Violin. Martin is the harmonious undercurrent to the lead vocals. Initially a trained light lyric soprano singer, Martin still manages to break through the band's catchy hooks with her binding melodies.</p>
        <h3>Alex Mackey</h3>
        <p class="mackey">Lead Guitar. After teaching himself guitar in middle school, Mackey knew he was meant to perform for the rest of his life. Considered the backbone of the music by his bandmates, Mackey brings songs to life on stage.</p>
        <h3>Michael Bowles</h3>
        <p class="bowles">Drummer. If his bandmates are considered binding elements to the music, then Bowles is the pulse. With a personality as powerful as his beats, his dynamic rhythms make The Cements never sound the same.</p>
